## Contributing

Always create a feature branch off of `master` all changes should be submitted via pull-request to `master`. Assign @webbushka as a **Reviewer** for the pull request. Eventually we will have CI setup to show tests passing before merging can be completed. For now I will pull your branch and run tests and coverage to check and make sure everything is working.
